# Telegram Bot
by 22sk

This [Telegram](https://telegram.org) [Bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots) serves some useful and fun functions such as `/user` (Outputs information about an user) and `/meme` (Sends a specific meme from a JSON-serialized meme collection hosted on Gist).

If you want to use those commands, you are welcome to add [22bot](https://telegram.me/sk22bot) to your chat. Else, you can edit the source code you can find here on GitHub to make it fit your needs, as long as my username and the URL to this GitHub-repository stays in the `/about`-Command's output.

Please keep in mind this the project is still in **alpha**!
